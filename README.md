# Kiewit Employee App

Welcome to my repo for a basic React app displaying employee information!


## Set up

To install all dependencies and modules, make sure you have all of the files pulled down and you're in the root directory. You'll also need to have Node running on your machine (I was using v10.15.3 while developing this). Once you do that, run `npm install`. The `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` should appear after this command finishes executing.


## Open the page

To finally see the webpage, all you need to do is run `npm start` and navigate to `localhost:3000` on your web browser. Currently, the webpack and other modules are set up for development mode. If you were to send this to production, there would need to be a few modifications.
